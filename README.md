## _Infosys Springboard - Handwritten Digit Recognition with LeNet5 Model in PyTorch_


[Infosys Springboard](https://infyspringboard.onwingspan.com/web/en/login)

An Internship project of Infosys in the feild of Artificial Intelligence, on Handwritten Digit Recognition
Using various Deep learnig Architecture and then deploying the model



## Features

 > Trying various deep learnig models
 > Improving model accuracy
 > Deploying all models together in one web app
 > Making evaluation Report of the project

## Tech

We uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

- [LeNet-5](https://www.kaggle.com/code/blurredmachine/lenet-architecture-a-complete-guide) - A  Simple CNN Architecture
- [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) - A Machine Learning Library
- [MNIST](https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/mnist#:~:text=The%20MNIST%20database%20(Modified%20National,test%20set%20of%2010%2C000%20examples. ) - Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology database Containing Handwritten Digits
- [Extended MNIST](https://www.nist.gov/itl/products-and-services/emnist-dataset) - EMNIST Dataset Is A Set of Handwritten Character Digit
- [CNN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network#Architecture) - Convolutional Neural Network Architecture
- [MLP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multilayer_perceptron) - Multilayer Perceptron
- [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/) - A Backend Micro-Framework Written In Python For The Rapid Development Process
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) - A software platform to build, test, and deploy applications quickly
